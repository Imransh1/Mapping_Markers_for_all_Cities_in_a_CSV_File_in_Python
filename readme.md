This repo contains code to convert any .csv file containing city names into a html file that shows markers on the world map for each city in the .csv file

Markers will change as soon as the city names changes or more cities are added in the .csv file.
Just need to run this file once in order to implement changes.
open the users.html file created after execution in any browser to see the output.
You can do many more things try to explore it more.

Please Note - You can optimize this code much further depending on your skills and knowledge. also you can add many elements to it.

I have attached another file called 'folium_indepth.py' just to show you more other things you could do on your map. Heatmaps can also be made using folium or seaborn modules.

Peace Out :-)
